HS3 stands for Heuristics-based Scala Sudoku Solver.

Original name, eh?

This is an exercise in learning Scala, while at the same time proving to my friends that I can solve Sudokus in a few miliseconds each. 

I have implemented only the simplest heuristics: Naked Tuples and Hidden Tuples, which allows me to solve about half the difficult problems in an average of 30ms. Depending on my free time in the future I might implement more advanced techniques.

The repository includes the files needed for the Eclipse project, but feel free to ignore those if you choose a different environment.

The only dependencies I am using are SLF4J and log4j for logging..
